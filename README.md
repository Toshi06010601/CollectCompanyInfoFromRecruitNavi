This is a UiPath program designed to help sales person with making a list of companies to do sales activity such as phone call or visit. The code structure is easy to understand and maintain. Please feel free to download it and modify it to suit your need. *It generates list of companies out of Recruit Navi website and attach it on an email and send to the designated email address.

Tip1 : If you publish it to UiPath orchestrator, you can type into "search word" and "search area" as argument.

Tip2 : If you install the orchestrator app on your mobile, you can remotely ask RPA robot to make sales list at the touch of button.

Tip3 : If you need additional information such as number of employees, name of a founder and so on, you can simply add columns in template file and process instruction file. (Which needs to be in line with data name on Recruit Navi website.)
