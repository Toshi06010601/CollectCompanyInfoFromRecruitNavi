Tip1 : If you publish it to UiPath orchestrator, you can type into "search word" and "search area" as argument.

Tip2 : If you install the orchestrator app on your mobile, you can remotely ask RPA robot to make sales list at the touch of button.

Tip3 : If you need additional information such as number of employees, name of a founder and so on, you can simply add columns in template file as well as process instruction file. (Which needs to be in line with data row name on Recruit Navi website.)
